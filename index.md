            <h2>About Me</h2>
Welcome to my website! My name is Mahmoud Elsharawy, and I am a Cornell University undergraduate student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am particularly interested in robotics and aviation. I am also a member of <a href="https://cuauv.org/">Autonomous Underwater Vehicle</a>, a project team at Cornell where we design and manufacture a robotic submarine. To get a glimpse of my past and current personal projects, check out the other tabs!
