            <h2>About Me</h2>
Welcome to my website! My name is Mahmoud Elsharawy, and I am a Cornell University undergraduate student majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering. I am particularly interested in Microelectronics and Artificial Intelligence. I am also a member of <a href="https://cuair.org/">Cornell University Unmanned Air Systems</a>, a project team at Cornell dedicated to designing and manufacturing an autonomous airplane. To get a glimpse of my past and current personal projects, check out the other tabs!
